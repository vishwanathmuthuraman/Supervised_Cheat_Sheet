# Supervised Machine Learning Cheat Sheet
![Alt Text](Supervised Machine Learning.gif)

I designed this cheat sheet to help newcomers in this field since I had no help and was overwhelmed by all the different kinds of models available (and when/how to use each one).

At the time, It would have been more convenient if there had been an instruction manual of some sort that summarized step-by-step how to select the required model without having to go through multiple sources to find documentation and a general syntax for using it.

This sheet summarizes the most widely used models and how to use them and when to select each one.

Now try using cross-validation or grid search cv with these for hyperparameter tuning and you’re golden. 

Suggestions are always welcome, if anyone feels like I’ve missed something or if you guys would like me to add something specific to this cheat sheet please feel free to comment or shoot me a dm. Thank you for reading if you find this resourceful please share it with others.
